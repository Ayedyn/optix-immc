= README for examples =

In this folder, you will find a number of examples 
to validate, test, or demonstrate the functionalities 
of MMC.

Please read the README.txt file for each sub-folder
to understand the purpose, procedures to run the simulation 
and the interpretations of the results.

The examples contained in each subfolders are explained below:

examples/
|-validation - homogeneous cubic domain 60x60x60, i.e. Fig. 2 in Fang2010
|-meshtest   - 10mm sphere embedded in the cubic domain, Fig. 3 in Fang2010
|-mcxsph     - scripts to run MCX for the above two cases
|-onecube    - debugging flag show case 1, simple mesh without reflection
|-reftest    - debugging flag show case 2, simple mesh with reflection
|-rngtest    - random number generator test
|-misctest   - other misc. tests
|-mouse      - legacy example
|-sphbox     - legacy example
