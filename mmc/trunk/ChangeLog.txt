2010/05/19 use elem-volume, update tests, twig parameters
2010/05/19 use MCX approach for fluence accumulation, debugged normalization, tested with benchmarks
2010/05/13 updated POSIX MT RNG to the 48bit version (drand48_r)
2010/05/10 added POSIX MT and logistic RNGs, use MCX interface, improved OpenMP efficiency
2010/05/09 debugged meshtest case, flexible mesh generation using improved iso2mesh toolbox
2010/05/07 isolated photon simulation commands into a function
2010/05/07 created sortmesh.m in iso2mesh to increase memory consistency and reduce cache miss
2010/05/06 added meshreorient.m in iso2mesh to ensure the correct tetrahedron node orientation
2010/05/05 added validation and mesh test cases
2010/05/04 added matlab utilities for mesh generation and result processing
2010/05/01 fluence normalization and SSE4 support
2010/04/22 added support for time-resolved imaging, use node voronoi-volume to normalize
2010/04/21 major code cleaning up, bug fixes for scattering handling
2010/04/18 update weight-recording scheme, only save the absorbed energy, need revisit
2010/01/01 used gprof to optimize,add debuglevel,add weight middle pt at pin and pout
2009/12/30 added examples: sphere-box, port mcx_utils from MCX (mcx.sf.net)
